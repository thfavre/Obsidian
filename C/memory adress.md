#C

## Concept :
- The memory address is the location where the variable is stored on the computer
- When we assign a value to the variable, it is stored in this memory address
- To access it, use the reference operator (&), and the result will represent where the variable is stored
## Example : 
```C
int myAge = 43; printf("%p", &myAge); // Outputs 0x7ffe5367e044
```
- &... is called a pointer. A pointer stores the memory address of a variable as its values.
